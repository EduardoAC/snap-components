# Snap Components

**Snap Components** is a component library built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It provides a collection of reusable, modular, and efficient UI components for modern web applications.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Fast** development with Vite
- ðŸ“¦ **Library Mode** ready for publishing
- ðŸŽ¨ **Reusable Components** with customizable styles
- ðŸ›  **Developer-friendly** setup with support for hot-reloading and modern JavaScript/TypeScript

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (v8 or higher) or **Yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snap-components.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd snap-components
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Development Server

Start the development server to work on your components with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

By default, the development server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

You can preview the components here.

### Build

To build the library for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate the library in the `dist/` folder.

### Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Or:

```bash
yarn preview
```

### Scripts Overview

- **`dev`**: Starts the development server.
- **`build`**: Builds the library for production.
- **`preview`**: Serves the production build locally.
- **`test`** _(optional)_: Run tests if configured.
- **`lint`** _(optional)_: Run linters for code quality checks.
